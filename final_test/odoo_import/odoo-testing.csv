:white_check_mark: *The MAIN feature of Odoo Enterprise is _Odoo Studio_* – a *drag-and-drop app builder &amp; UI customizer* that lets you:
• Create custom fields, views, workflows, and reports *without coding*
• Customize existing Odoo apps visually
• Quickly prototype and deploy new business processes
This is the biggest differentiator from the Community edition because it allows non-technical users (business analysts, project managers) to tailor Odoo to their organization easily — no deep development needed.
Would you like me to create a *comparison table (Enterprise vs Community)* highlighting just the *top 5 differentiating features* (so you can present it to stakeholders)?",

odoo-testing,2025-09-22 18:49:30,U09GBG7HFA7,"Here are the key features of *Odoo Enterprise* (what you get beyond the Community / free edition), plus how they differ / what added value they deliver. If you want, I can also list features specific to Odoo version 18 (latest) or compare “must-have” ones for a specific type of business.

What is Odoo Enterprise
• Odoo Enterprise is the commercial/premium version of Odoo. It includes all the capabilities of the Community edition plus extra advanced features, official support, more polish, and additional modules.

(<https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1/odoo-18-0-enterprise-vs-community-on-premise-and-iot-274706?utm_source=chatgpt.com|Odoo>)
Trade-Offs / Things to Check
• Cost: Because it's subscription based, costs can rise with more users/modules. (<https://www.odoo-bs.com/about-odoo?utm_source=chatgpt.com|OBS Solutions>)
• Sometimes dependency on Odoo and partners for support and updates.
• You’ll want to verify which modules are available in your country, especially financial localizations.
If you tell me your business size, industry, or which modules you're considering (manufacturing, HR, eCommerce, etc.), I can suggest which Enterprise features you’ll most likely benefit from.",
